## Synopsis

A Java application used to anonymize records in CSV format using different de-identification techniques

## Motivation

One problem that hindrances data mining is the availability of nonconfidential data.
The data is often available but cannot be disclosed to researchers to protect the
privacy of the records' owners.

With this de-identification tool, records
can be anonymized to scrape out all the confidential information with the
properties of the attributes of the original data set being preserved.
